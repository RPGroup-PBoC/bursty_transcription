## `stan_samples`

This directory houses all MCMC samples generated by Stan.

Generally the samples should be generated locally here but not committed to the repo, since the samples can be trivially regenerated by running the relevant scripts, but if the samples aren't too large (few 10s of Mb or less) AND the sampling runtime is extreme (hours or more), it might be worth preserving them in the repo as well as locally. SBC is a prime example.
