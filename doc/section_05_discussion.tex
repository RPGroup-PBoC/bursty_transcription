\section{Discussion and future work}
\mmnote{Do all my approximations work simply because galK happens to have a low
duty cycle of supercoiling, $\beta/\alpha$ in Chong2014 picture? A potentially
interesting test: put in the dozen or so Hernan constructs at some other locus,
preferably one of the ones Chong identified as having a large duty cycle (large
$\beta/\alpha$), i.e., the opposite limit of galK. Then just measure
fold-changes. You don't even need to do FISH, although that would be even
better. If their model is right, $\rho$ should be approximately set by the duty
cycle of supercoiling, NOT by RNAP kinetics.
\textit{This is a NICE prediction for future work.} \textit{cspE}
is claimed nonessential, prediction is you drop HG reporter constructs in there
and the inferred binding energies of all lacI operators shift the same amount,
by about $\ln(3)\sim 1kT$. Not huge, but detectable, although might be
confounding effects from moving to a new locus. With FISH measurements, $k^+$
and $k^-$ in Fig 2, model 4 should now be separately inferrable if Chong2014
measurements of $\beta/\alpha$ are correct. This would require an obnoxious
amount of cloning, but once you did that, the measurements would be same old
stuff that RP lab does.}
