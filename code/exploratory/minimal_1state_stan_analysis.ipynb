    "The posterior predictive checks make it pretty clear that this most simple of models is not entirely capable of producing the observed data for all the promoters. The observed data has a pretty stereotyped pattern on the difference-in-ECDF plots. This strongly suggests there is something systematic our model fails to capture. Nevertheless, looking at the full ecdfs, I'm actually pleasantly surprised that the model does as well as it does. We haven't explicitly put in anything like cell cycle & gene copy number variability, and yet it captures quite a lot. Maybe it's already robust enough to attempt inference on simple repression data?"

(Note that `hv.Contours` prefers its input as a dictionary: `\"x\"` and `\"y\"` keys must be labeled as such and provide the coords of the contour, and a 3rd key providing a scalar for the contour level, here the promoter binding energy which we lookup.) Then we can overlay all the contours, colored by their corresponding promoter binding energy (fat lines make it easier to perceive the color)."

By eye I'd say there's little to no correlation between burst size $b$ and binding energy, and maybe linear scaling between the log of burst frequency $\\alpha$ and binding energy, though that correlation is quite noisy. Not immediately obvious how to proceed from a theory/modeling viewpoint."
